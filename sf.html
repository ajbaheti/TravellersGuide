					"bean," is one of the highlights of Millennium Park. Designed by
					the artists Anish Kapoor, the Chicago the Bean sculpture is made of
					168 highly polished stainless steel plates - giving the appearance
					of liquid mercury. Up close, the highly reflective nature of the
					sculpture captures the beautiful skyline of Chicago. The Cloud Gate
					Sculpture has thus become a tourist hot spot and is the perfect
					place to take your vacation snapshots.</p>

				</header>
				<p class="paragraph">Times Square is a major commercial intersection and neighborhood in Midtown Manhattan, New York City, 
				at the junction of Broadway and Seventh Avenue, and stretching from West 42nd to West 47th Streets.
				Brightly adorned with billboards and advertisements, Times Square is sometimes referred to as The Crossroads of the World,
				The Center of the Universe, the heart of The Great White Way, and the "heart of the world". 
				One of the world's busiest pedestrian intersections, it is also the hub of the Broadway Theater District and 
				a major center of the world's entertainment industry. Times Square is one of the world's most visited tourist attractions, 
				drawing an estimated 50 million visitors annually. Approximately 330,000 people pass through Times Square daily, 
				many of them tourists; while over 460,000 pedestrians walk through Times Square on its busiest days. Formerly Longacre Square, 
				Times Square was renamed in 1904 after The New York Times moved its headquarters to the newly erected Times Building, 
				the site of the annual ball drop which began on December 31, 1907, and continues today, attracting over a million visitors 
				to Times Square every New Year's Eve.</p>

				</header>
				<p class="paragraph">The Brooklyn Bridge is a hybrid cable-stayed/suspension bridge in New York City and 
				is one of the oldest bridges of either type in the United States. Completed in 1883, 
				it connects the boroughs of Manhattan and Brooklyn by spanning the East River. 
				It has a main span of 1,595.5 feet (486.3 m), and was the first steel-wire suspension bridge constructed. 
				It was originally referred to as the New York and Brooklyn Bridge and as the East River Bridge, 
				but it was later dubbed the Brooklyn Bridge, a name coming from an earlier January 25, 1867, 
				letter to the editor of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, and formally so named by the city government in 1915. 
				Since its opening, it has become an icon of New York City, and was designated a National Historic Landmark 
				in 1964 and a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark in 1972.</p>

				until the World Trade Center was completed in 1972, and was again New York City's tallest building 
				after the World Trade Center was destroyed in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 until 2013.</p>
